Feature Info
"Refers to the design and configuration of the engine. Most petrol bikes typically use either a single-cylinder, twin-cylinder, or occasionally a multi-cylinder (like a four-cylinder) engine."
""
"Represents the highest rotational force output by the engine, usually measured in Newton-meters (Nm) or pound-feet (lb-ft). It indicates the engine's pulling power."
"Indicates the total count of combustion cylinders in the engine. Common configurations include single-cylinder, twin-cylinder, and four-cylinder setups."
Describes the method used to dissipate heat from the engine. Petrol bikes often use air-cooling or liquid-cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures.
Refers to the number of intake and exhaust valves present in each cylinder. Most modern petrol bike engines have two or four valves per cylinder.
"Describes how the engine is initiated. Most petrol bikes use electric starters, kick starters, or both, to commence engine operation."
""
"Indicates the arrangement of gears that transmit power from the engine to the wheels, allowing the rider to adjust speed and torque."
These measurements describe the diameter (bore) and length (stroke) of the cylinder in the engine. They directly affect an engine's performance characteristics.

Reflects the ratio of the maximum volume in the cylinder (when the piston is at the bottom) to the minimum volume (when the piston is at the top) during the engine cycle. Higher compression ratios generally lead to more efficient combustion.
"Specifies the level of emissions produced by the bike, conforming to regulatory standards. Petrol bikes typically adhere to norms like Euro or BS (Bharat Stage) emissions standards."
"This refers to the display panel on a petrol bike that shows essential information like speed, RPM, fuel level, and other indicators such as engine temperature and gear position."

"Displays the current speed of the bike in kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph), providing crucial information for safe riding."
"Tracks the distance traveled during a specific journey or trip, enabling riders to monitor their mileage for individual rides."
"Shows the total distance covered by the bike since its inception, providing a comprehensive record of its usage"
